# Azure Automation: The Good Parts

## Intro

ðŸ“·*GIF Copying files*

- Remember when deployment was like this?
- I do, and unfortunately, it was not too long ago
- 2 years ago, came onto a new team where deployment was a manual copy and paste via SFTP
- Avoided full CI/CD process because it was "too complicated"

## But what about:
- Reliability
- Speed
- Tools?!

ðŸ“· HELLO - Azure DevOps

## Luckily, within the next 3-6 months, had opportunity to set up CI/CD from scratch

## Structure
Portfolios 
Post Sale
Compliance
Client Setup
User Setup

## Typical Workflow
1. Code
2. Push to remote
3. Code Review
4. Merge into master pending following steps pass (dev/qa/staging/prod):
    - Run Unit Tests
    - Run Automated UI Tests
    - Run Integration Tests
5. Functional testing (QA) 
6. Approval to higher environments
7. Approval to release
8. Release created
9. It's in PROD!

## Which steps to automate?

## Which CAN we automate?

## What still needs manual intervention?

- Code review processes (hopefully!)

## Context of Infrastructure

- DEV
- QA
- PROD

Several projects, each housed in their own repo
